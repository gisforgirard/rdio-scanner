## Upgrading from version 3

- Your `server/.env` file will be used to create the new `server/config.json` file. Then the `server/.env` will be deleted.
- The `rdioScannerSystems` table will be used to create the _rdioScanner.systems_ within `server/config.json`. Then the `rdioScannerSystems` table will be purged.
- The `rdioScannerCalls` table will be rebuilt, which can be pretty long on some systems.
- It is no longer possible to upload neither your TALKGROUP.CSV nor you ALIAS.CSV files to _Rdio Scanner_. Instead, you have to define them in the `server/config.json` file.

> YOU SHOULD BACKUP YOUR `SERVER/.ENV` FILE AND YOUR DATABASE PRIOR TO UPGRADING, JUST IN CASE. WE'VE TESTED THE UPGRADE PROCESS MANY TIMES, BUT WE CAN'T KNOW FOR SURE IF IT'S GOING TO WORK WELL ON YOUR SIDE.
